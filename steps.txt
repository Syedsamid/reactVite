// Inistallation of React Vite

1. Create a new repository of your project name 
2. git clone ssh-url
3. cd repoName
4. npm create vite@latest
// Vite is a bundler tool for react setup 
// vite is faster then CRA
// React is a Library for Building UI Components
// React deals with Virtual DOM

5. Enter project name as client
6. Select REact and next JavaScript
7. cd client
8. npm install
9. npm run dev

// by default CRA it takes 3000 port number
// But Vite uses 5173 port number

10. delete eslint.config.JavaScript
11. Remove StrictMode from main.js also Remove the import of it
12. Clear index.css and App.css
13. Clear App.js and Add rafce Hello World import React from 'react'
import React from 'react'

function App() {
  return (
    <>
    
    <h1>Hello samid</h1>
    
    </>
  )
}

export default App


14. open index.html and change title
15. open index.html and meta tags and favicon
16. JSX ==> javascript XML people also say as JavaScript + HTML
17. Flow of React
- App.jsx ==> Hello World ==> Export main.jsx
- main.jsx ==> root ==> index.html
18. Why React why not html
- HTML uses JAvaSscript DOM- Changing an single element or Button takes whole page to reload
from  start

- But in REact it uses something called Virtual DOM
- It will clone the Original DOM and m=Makes a copy of DOM called Virtual DOM

Virtual dom changess the component 
React Compares the changed element and it will only render that component
- Virtual DOM changes or render the only component which is new or changed recently from Original DOM


// Hooks are the special types of functions in react
